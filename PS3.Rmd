Total Points: 

**1** Use the SOI data set (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/SOI.txt) to create side-by-side boxplots showing the distribution of SOI values by month. Hint: First convert the wide data frame to a long data frame (10).

**2** Use the `mpg` data frame to create a scatter plot showing highway mileage on the vertical axis and engine displacement on the horizontal axis. Map the `class` variable to the *shape* aesthetic (5).

**3** Use the Olympic athlete dataset (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/athlete_events.csv) to create a density plot showing the distribution of athlete heights by sex for those winning gold during the summer games (20).
```{r}
ae.df <- read.csv(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/athlete_events.csv",
                  header = TRUE) %>%
  filter(Season == "Summer" & Medal == "Gold") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Height)) %>%
  distinct(Name, .keep_all = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ae.df, mapping = aes(x = Height, color = Sex)) +
  geom_density()
```

**4** Use the same dataset as in problem 3 to create scatter plots showing the relationship between height and weight for women athletes during the summer games grouped (faceted) by medal (20).
```{R}
ae.df <- read.csv(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/athlete_events.csv",
                  header = TRUE) %>%
  filter(Season == "Summer", !is.na(Medal), Sex = "F") %>%
  distinct(Name, .keep_all = TRUE)

ggplot(ae.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Medal)
```
