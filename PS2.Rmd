**1** The following values are the annual number of hurricanes that have hit the United States since 1990. Answer the questions by typing the correct R code.

0 1 1 1 0 2 2 1 3 3 0 0 1 2 6 6 0 1 3 0 1

a. Import the data. (2)

b. How many years are there? (2)

c. Find the total number of hurricanes over all years? (2)

**2** Consider the monthly precipitation dataset from my website (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLMonthlyP.txt).

a. Import the data. (2)

b. What are the wettest and driest values during the month of January? (2)

c. Sort the February rainfall values from *wettest* to *driest*. (2)

d. Compute the variance of the June rainfall values. (2)

e. What is the 95th percentile value of July rainfall? (2)

f. Create a graph of August rainfall with year along the horizontal axis. (4)

**3** The dataset *hflights* from the **hflights** package contains all 227,496 airline flights that departed Houston in 2011. Using the functions in the **dplyr** package do the following:

a. Create a new data frame from *hflights* containing only those flights that departed on September 11th of that year. (5)

b. Determine how many flights departed on that day. (5)

c. Create a data frame with the first column being the tail number and the second being the number of departures from Houston the plane made that year sorted by most to least number of flights. (5)

**4** With the tornado dataset (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/Tornadoes.txt) [each row is a unique tornado] do the following. 

a. Import the data. (2)

b. Use the functions `group_by()` and `summarize()` to determine the number of tornadoes by state. (5)

c. Create a new column with path length in meters (the length variable is in miles). Create a new data frame by removing rows with EF damage rating less than 3. Group by year and summarize the average path length. Make a graph with year on the x axis and average path length on the y axis. (10)

d. Compute the number of tornadoes with EF damage rating (`FSCALE`) 1 or higher by year and graph the results as a time series (year along the horizontal axis). (10)

e. Create a data frame with the year in the first column and the total number of tornadoes in Kansas by year in the second column. List the first six rows of this new data frame. (5)
