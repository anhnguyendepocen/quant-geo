**1** The following values are the annual number hurricanes that have hit the United States since 1990. Answer the questions by typing R commands.

0 1 1 1 0 2 2 1 3 3 0 0 1 2 6 6 0 1 3 0 1

a. Enter the data into R. (2)

b. How many years are there? (2)

c. What is the total number of hurricanes over all years? (2)

**2** Answer the following questions by typing R commands.

a. Create a vector of numbers starting with -5 and ending with 2. (2)

b. What is the length of this vector? (2)

c. Create a new vector from the original vector by subtracting the mean value over all numbers in the vector. (2)

**3** Suppose you keep track of your mileage each time you fill your car's gas tank. At your last 8 fill-ups the mileage was

65311 65624 65908 66219 66499 66821 67145 67447

a. Enter these numbers into a vector called  miles. (2)

b. Use the function `diff()` to determine the number of miles between fill-ups. (2)

c. What is the maximum, minimum, and mean number of miles between fill-ups?  (3)

**4** Create the following sequences using the `seq()` and `rep()` functions as appropriate.

a.  "a", "a", "b", "b", "b" (2)

b.  The even numbers in the interval from 1 to 100 (2)

c.  1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3  (2)

d.  1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3  (2)


**5** Read the monthly precipitation dataset from my website (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLMonthlyP.txt).

a. What are the wettest and driest values for the month of June? (2)

b. Sort the January rainfall values from *wettest* to *driest*. (2)

c. Compute the variance of the June rainfall values. (2)

d. What is the 95th percentile value of June rainfall? (2)

e. Create a graph of June rainfall with year along the horizontal axis. (4)
