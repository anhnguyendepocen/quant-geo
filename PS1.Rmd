**1** Use the `mpg` data frame in the `ggplot2` package to create a scatter plot showing how fuel consumption in cars during highway driving depends on engine displacement. Hint: let the horizontal axis (`x = `) be the variable `displ` and the vertical axis (`y = `) be the variable `hwy`. Type: `?mpg` for details on the variables in the data frame. (6)

**2** Remake the scatter plot by coloring the points according to the number of cylinders (`cyl`). (3)

**3** Assign to an object `x` the sum of 3 and 5. Find the square root of the sum. (4)

**4** Create a vector `h` with the following integers and create a table of frequencies: 2 4 0 3 1 0 0 1 2 0. Hint: use the `table()` function. (4)

**5** Find the mean and median values for the set of integers assigned in question **4**. (4)
