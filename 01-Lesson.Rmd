### Description

Quantitative geographic methods are useful for addressing many of the problems facing our world today. Knowing about various methods and being able to use them are vital for offering solutions. In this course I will teach you quantitative methods using the R programming language.

### Objectives & Expected Learning Outcomes

The course has the following expected learning outcomes:

* Factual: You will acquire fundamental knowledge of statistical methods in data analysis. You will become familiar with the terminology used to describe data and the statistical procedures and outcomes applied in quantitative geographical analysis.

* Conceptual: You will develop an understanding of some of the statistical tools and when to apply them in data analysis and modeling. You will cultivate a first-order understanding of the motivations, advantages, and disadvantages for different methods and how uncertainties in the data and methods propagate through your analysis.

* Procedural: You will learn how to use R to analyze, graph, and model data. You will learn how to analyze data statistically and how to make your analysis reproducible. You will be able to interpret the results of your model in terms of the physical variables. You will be able to explain the significance of effects. You will learn enough R to be able to build on this knowledge throughout your career.

* Meta cognitive: You will recognize the potential and some limitations of statistical and data analytic methods with respect to the constraints set by the underlying physical and deterministic processes you seek to explore. You will be able to identify reasonable inferences or conclusions from your analyses. You will gain an appreciation for the importance of open-source research.

I expect you to have some understanding of descriptive statistical concepts such as means, standard deviations, and correlation as well as some basic knowledge of inference (e.g., $t$-test). Everything you do in this class will be done using R/RStudio.

There is _no required textbook_ for this course but you are responsible for working through the code given in each lesson.
